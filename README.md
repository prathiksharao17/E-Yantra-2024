# E-Yantra Robotics 2024 - Warehouse Drone 

## **Theme: Smart Warehouse Automation**  
In the heart of a smart city, a **quadcopter drone** revolutionizes warehouse logistics by autonomously locating and retrieving crucial packages. With e-commerce demand surging, efficient **automated warehouse management** is essential.  

## **About the Competition**  
The **E-Yantra Robotics 2024** competition is structured in **two stages**:  
1️ . **Simulation Phase:** We first develop and test our drone in a virtual warehouse environment using **ROS 2 and Gazebo**.  
2️ . **Real-World Deployment:** After refining our algorithms in simulation, we transition to building a **physical drone** and test it in real-world conditions.  

This approach ensures that our drone is **optimized, tested, and ready** before actual deployment. 

## **Mission Overview**  
- **Path Planning:** Efficiently mapping and navigating warehouse environments.  
- **PID Control:** Ensuring smooth, stable, and precise flight movements.  
- **Autonomous Navigation:** Real-time decision-making to avoid obstacles and reach targets.  
- **Aruco Marker Detection:** Identifying and tracking markers for precise localization and package identification.

## **Technology Stack**  
- **Ubuntu + ROS 2:** The system is developed and tested on **Ubuntu** with **ROS 2** for real-time control and automation.  
- **Gazebo:** Simulating warehouse environments for mission planning.  
- **OpenCV:** For object detection and tracking packages.
