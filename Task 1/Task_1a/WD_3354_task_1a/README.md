# Task 1A - Turtlesim Drone Controller

## Introduction

This task involves creating a ROS 2 Python script to control **Turtlesim** and draw a drone-like structure. The turtle will move to specific points to form four circles , a square , and connecting lines.
## Implementation Breakdown

1. **Initialize ROS 2 Node**  
   - Define `DroneDrawer` node with:  
     - Publisher for `/turtle1/cmd_vel`.  
     - Service clients for `/turtle1/teleport_absolute` and `/turtle1/set_pen`.  

2. **Teleporting the Turtle**  
   - `teleport_turtle(x, y, theta)`: Instantly moves the turtle to a given position.  

3. **Setting the Pen**  
   - `set_pen(r, g, b, width, off)`: Configures pen color, thickness, and enables/disables drawing.  

4. **Drawing a Circle (Propellers)**  
   - `draw_circle(radius)`: Moves the turtle in a circular path using velocity commands.  

5. **Drawing the Square (Drone Frame)**  
   - `draw_square()`:  
     - Teleports and moves turtle to draw a square.  
     - Ensures smooth transitions with calculated distances and angles.  

6. **Drawing the Connecting Lines**  
   - `draw_lines_to_square_edges()`:  
     - Connects each circleâ€™s center to the nearest edge midpoint of the square.  
     - Uses teleportation followed by a straight movement.  

7. **Executing the Full Drawing**  
   - `draw_drone()`:  
     - Disables pen before teleportation.  
     - Draws four circles, the square, and the connecting lines.  
     - Ends by teleporting turtle to center `(5.0, 5.0)`.
