# E-Yantra Robotics 2024 - Task 1  

## Overview  
Task 1 focuses on building a strong foundation in ROS 2, drone control, and image processing through three sub-tasks. Participants will:  
- Develop a controller for Turtlesim or a drone  
- Implement PID control for drone stabilization using a Python script and UI-based fine-tuning  
- Apply image processing techniques, including ArUco marker detection and perspective transformation, to generate a 2D map  


## Task Breakdown  

### Task 1A - Controlling the Drone Using Turtlesim Commands  
**Objective:** Develop a simple controller using Python/C++ to perform a specific maneuver using Turtlesim commands to move the drone.  
Topics covered:  
- Writing ROS 2 nodes in Python/C++  
- Implementing publisher-subscriber architecture  
- Executing precise movement commands  

### Task 1B - PID Control for Swift Pico Drone  
**Objective:** Design a PID control system to stabilize the Swift Pico Drone at any specified position in Gazebo.  
Topics covered:  
- Understanding PID controllers  
- Writing a Python script for PID-based control  
- Fine-tuning PID gains using a UI and visualizing performance with PlotJuggler  

### Task 1C - Image Processing for 2D Mapping  
**Objective:** Apply image processing techniques to create a 2D map that aids drone navigation.  
Topics covered:   
- Feature detection and obstacle identification  
- Perspective transformation for accurate mapping  
- ArUco marker detection for localization and mapping
